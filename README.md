**Exploratory Data (EDA)** is an approach in analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. This helps in getting a better understanding of the data, discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

In this EDA Project I am going to analyze a dataset which contains the demand of hotel bookings. I got this dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand). The data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

**Outline of the Project:**
- Installing and importing the required libraries
- Data preparation and cleaning
- Exploratory analysis and visualization of columns
- Asking and answering questions about the data
- Summary
- References and ideas for future work
